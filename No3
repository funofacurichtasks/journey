2- Changes in work processes
Automation and digitalisation have a significant impact on the labour market, leading to increased demand for digital skills and changing labour needs. Technological advances also have an impact on the forms of labour relations and the organisation of work processes.

3. Environmental impact
The use of new technologies can lead to negative environmental impacts such as depletion of natural resources, pollution, climate change and other problems. However, technology also presents the potential to create environmentally sustainable solutions.

4. Cybersecurity and privacy
The development of new technologies and the digitalisation of society pose new threats to cybersecurity and privacy. With the emergence of new technologies, the need for privacy and cybersecurity increases.

5. ethical issues and regulation of technology
Technological progress also raises issues of ethics in the use of new technologies and the need for appropriate legislation and regulation in this area.

By analysing these aspects, it is possible to understand the scope and importance of technological progress and to identify the challenges it poses to modern society. Understanding these challenges will help to create more sustainable strategies for the development of technology and its application in the future.
